# Fantasy League Historical Results Viewer

## Project Overview

This project aims to develop a web application that enables members of our fantasy football league to view historical results, including individual game matchups and overall standings, dating back to the 2020 season. The application will leverage Python, the YFPY package, and web development technologies to fetch, process, and display data in an interactive and user-friendly manner.

## Goals

- **Data Retrieval**: Fetch historical matchup and standings data from the Yahoo Fantasy Sports API.
- **Data Presentation**: Display individual game matchups and overall standings for each season since 2020, including playoff results.
- **User Interface**: Develop an intuitive and engaging user interface for league members to interact with the data.
- **Scalability and Performance**: Ensure the application can handle growing data and user base efficiently.
